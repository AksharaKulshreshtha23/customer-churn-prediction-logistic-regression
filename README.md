Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression
**Project Overview

This project implements a Logistic Regression model to predict whether a customer will churn based on demographic and service-related features. The goal is to analyze patterns in customer behavior and generate probability-based predictions.

🛠 Technologies Used
Python
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
Scikit-learn

⚙️ Steps Performed

Data preprocessing and cleaning
Feature scaling using StandardScaler
Train-test split
Model training using Logistic Regression
Performance evaluation using Log Loss and Accuracy

** Results

The model successfully predicts customer churn and provides probability estimates for classification. Performance was evaluated using accuracy and log loss metrics.

Future Improvements

Try additional models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)

Perform hyperparameter tuning

Improve feature selection
